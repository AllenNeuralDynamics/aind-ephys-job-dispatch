description: |-
  This capsule is designed to dispatch jobs for the AIND pipeline.

  It assumes the data is stored in the data/ directory, and creates as many JSON files as the number of jobs that can be run in parallel. Each job consists of a recording with spiking activity that needs spike sorting.
